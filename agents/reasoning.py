"""Genuine agent reasoning layer (DeepSeek via the OpenAI-compatible API).

The agents call these to actually DECIDE at the economic decision points (criterion 1):
  - client_decide_fund: is this task worth funding within policy/budget?
  - provider_do_task:    actually perform the task (produce the deliverable).
  - evaluate:            the real accept/reject judgment on the deliverable.

CAW Pacts remain the hard boundary regardless of what the LLM decides - that's the safety story.
Every call is logged (decision + rationale) so the demo's audit trail is legible.
